## Era
The game is set in a far future cosmic era where stellar light is rare and energy gradients are scarce. Civilization survives by scavenging structured matter from debris fields and derelict fleets.

## Setting Rules
- Most regions are cold and dark; bright stars are dangerous and uncommon.
- Black holes remain major gravitational landmarks and lethal navigation traps.
- Useful materials are concentrated in relic sites: planet shards, asteroid nests, wreck clusters.
- Factions fight over low-entropy resources rather than territory.

## Factions
- Drift Pilgrims: nomads preserving archives and old reactor tech.
- Null Reclaimers: aggressive salvagers stripping any active outpost.
- Custodian Drones: autonomous defense systems still obeying dead empires.

## Player Role
Captain of the Ark-Frame vessel, tasked with maintaining Outpost Ember, a last engineered thermal island in a decaying cosmos.

## Narrative Tone
Melancholic survival with moments of discovery. The world should feel vast, silent, and dangerous due to physics and scarcity.
