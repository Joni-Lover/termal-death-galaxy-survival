# Thermal Death: Galaxy Survival - Vision

## Product Goal
Create a 2D open-space survival game where the player explores in all four directions, scavenges remnants of dead systems, and keeps a defensive outpost alive in a near-heat-death universe.

## Fantasy
You are a lone captain preserving pockets of order against cosmic entropy.

## Core Loop
1. Leave the outpost and scan nearby sectors.
2. Salvage resources from asteroids, planetary shards, and ship wrecks.
3. Avoid hazards (suns and black holes) and hostile drones.
4. Return to outpost, deposit cargo, stabilize energy, unlock upgrades.
5. Repeat with higher risk farther from origin.

## Pillars
- Open navigation: free movement in four directions with inertial flight.
- Entropy pressure: energy decline and module wear force decisions.
- Risk zones: hazards are navigation puzzles, not just damage fields.
- Sparse wonder: rare POIs in a cold, mostly empty universe.

## MVP Success Metrics
- 20 minute survival loop with meaningful progression.
- Distinct playstyle from corridor shooter (explore > fight).
- Difficulty presets that clearly alter economy and risk.
